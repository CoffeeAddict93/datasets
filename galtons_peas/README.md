# Galton's peas

These are the original data from Galton (1894) Table 2 in Natural Inheritance,
reproduced in Table 2 of:

    Jeffrey M. Stanton (2001) Galton, Pearson, and the Peas: A Brief History of
    Linear Regression for Statistics Instructors, Journal of Statistics
    Education, 9:3, DOI:
    [10.1080/10691898.2001.11910537](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2001.11910537)

`galtons_peas.csv` is the CSV that I downloaded from the HTML version of the
paper linked above.

The processing here just converts frequencies to individual observations.

I checked the processed data against the [R
version](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/psych/peas.html)
