These are the data from [Beer Consumption Increases Human Attractiveness to Malaria Mosquitoes](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0009546).

The first author, Dr [Thierry Lefèvre](https://sites.google.com/site/thierryelefevre), kindly sent the original data.

He released the data and derivatives under the [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) license.

```{python}
import os.path as op
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

`beer.txt` is the original data file as provided by Dr Lefèvre.

It is in tab-separated value format.

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('beer.txt', sep='\t')
df.head()
```

Here are the variable descriptions sent by Dr Lefèvre.

* `volunteer`: 43 levels corresponding to the id of the 43
  volunteers.
* `group`: 2 levels "beer" or "water" (= volunteers were
  assigned to either the beer (volunteer 1 to 25) or the water
  treatment (volunteer 26 to 43).
* `test`: 2 levels "after" or "before"  (the attractiveness of
  each volunteer was tested twice: before drinking and 15 min
  after drinking either water or beer).
* `nb_relased`: nb of released mosquitoes (n=50 for each test
  and group).
* `no_odour`: nb of caught mosquitoes in the "no_odour control
  trap".
* `volunt_odour`: nb of caught mosquitoes in the volunteer odour
  trap.
* `activated`: number of trapped mosquitoes (= no_odour
  volunt_odour).
* `co2no`: CO2 concentration in the no odour trap.
* `co2od`: CO2 concentration in the volunteer odour trap.
* `temp`: body temperature of the volunteer.
* `trapside`: 2 levels (A or B) this is the side of the
  volunteer odour treatment in the Y-olfactometer (volunteer
  odour on the right side: A or on the left side: B)
* `hour`: hour at which the test began.
* `date`: date of the test.


The `date` column looks like Excel format dates, which are
number of days since January 1st 1900 - see [this
explanation](http://www.cpearson.com/Excel/datetime.htm).

The paper has:

> Experiments were conducted between September and October 2007.

The dates should be in this range.

```{python}
dates = pd.to_datetime('1900-01-01') + pd.to_timedelta(df['date'], unit='days')
dates.describe()
```

Add the hours:

```{python}
date_times = dates + pd.to_timedelta(df['hour'], unit='hours')
date_times.head()
```

```{python}
clean_df = df.loc[:, :'trapside']
clean_df['datetime'] = date_times
clean_df.head()
```

Check the number released is always 50:

```{python}
np.all(clean_df['nb_released'] == 50)
```

Save without the index (row labels), and load to check it worked:

```{python}
out_path = op.join('processed', 'mosquito_beer.csv')
clean_df.to_csv(out_path, index=False)  # No row labels
# Read it back again.
pd.read_csv(out_path).head()
```
