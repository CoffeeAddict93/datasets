# US state data

From <https://data.world/uscensusbureau/fips-state-codes>.

Dataset summary:

> Codes for the identification of the States, the District of
> Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Insular Areas of the United
> States. Contains the 2-digit state FIPS code, postal
> abbreviation, and 8-digit Geographic Names Information Systems
> Identifier (GNISID)
>
> Source: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/fips-state-codes

In fact, the "postal abbreviation" seems to be the more general
[ANSI
code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_abbreviations)
- [paywalled source
    here](https://webstore.ansi.org/Standards/INCITS/INCITS382009R2014)

That source URL does not give a functioning link to these data,
that I can find, but it does give the license as "This dataset
is intended for public access and use."  I will assume the data is public domain.

Source for `us_states.csv` is
<https://data.world/uscensusbureau/fips-state-codes/workspace/file?filename=StatesFIPSCodes.csv>.

I have edited the variable names, and renamed the file.
