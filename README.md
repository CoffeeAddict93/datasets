# Interesting datasets for teaching data analysis

There is one directory per dataset.

Each directory contains the original data (if small enough), a Jupyter Notebook
or Python `.py` script or R Notebook or `.R` script to process the data, and
a directory `processed` with new copies of the data as output from the notebook
/ script.

The Jupyter notebooks are in native `.ipynb` format, and in `.Rmd` RMarkdown
format, for ease of editing and version control.

I use the excellent [Jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) to interact
with the RMarkdown versions of the files.

See the `README.md` file in each directory for license / copyright of the files
in that directory.

See `data_links.md` for links at which to search for datasets.
