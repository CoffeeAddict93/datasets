# Minard graph data

Data from the famous plot of Napoleon's 1812 Russian campaign by [Joseph
Charles Minard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard).

Data comes directly from the
[HistData](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HistData/index.html)
package in R - see `original/write_minard.R`.

That package is GPL 2 or GPL 3, but I do not believe this can be applied to
the data, as these are simple numbers and names, from an historical source.

I believe this also applies to my own arrangement of the data, but in so far
as that is not so, I release my arrangement of these data into the public
domain under the [PDDL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/index.html).
