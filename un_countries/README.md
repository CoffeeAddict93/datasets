# UN list of countries

A standard list of countries from the [UN statistics division
website](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/overview).

The data file is a version of the default CSV download from that site, with
some small edits to remove commas inside country names - see
`un_countries.patch`.

The file appears to be covered by [these license
terms](https://www.un.org/en/sections/about-website/terms-use/index.html):

I don't think those terms are enforcible for these data, hence my distribution
here.
